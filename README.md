# Comparative Machine Learning Analysis in Bioinformatics

## Introduction
This project focuses on comparative machine learning analysis in the field of bioinformatics, specifically examining gene expression data. The analysis involves various machine learning techniques, 
including Random Forest, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and other regression models, to predict and analyze gene expression scores.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Used for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
  - Key Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
- **R**: Employed for statistical analysis and visualization.
  - Key Libraries: `tidyverse`, `caret`, `e1071`, `rpart`, `randomForest`, `ggplot2`, `readr`, `ggpubr`

## Data Description
The project uses preprocessed gene expression data, including various features and a target variable (score). The data is analyzed to understand the relationships between different genes and their 
expression levels.

## Machine Learning Models and Techniques
- **Random Forest Regression (Python)**: Used for hyperparameter tuning and model fitting.
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR) (Python & R)**: Applied for modeling gene expression data with linear kernel.
- **Feature Selection and Analysis**: Mutual Information, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Correlation Analysis.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Baseline Comparison**: Comparison with a dummy regressor to establish baseline performance.
