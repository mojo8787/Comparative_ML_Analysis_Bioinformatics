Comparative Machine Learning Analysis in Bioinformatics

Introduction

This project focuses on comparative machine learning analysis in the field 
of bioinformatics, specifically examining gene expression data. The 
analysis involves various machine learning techniques, including Random 
Forest, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and other regression models, to 
predict and analyze gene expression scores.

Technologies and Libraries Used

Python: Used for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
Key Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib
R: Employed for statistical analysis and visualization.
Key Libraries: tidyverse, caret, e1071, rpart, randomForest, ggplot2, 
readr, ggpubr
Data Description

The project uses preprocessed gene expression data, including various 
features and a target variable (score). The data is analyzed to understand 
the relationships between different genes and their expression levels.

Machine Learning Models and Techniques

Random Forest Regression (Python): Used for hyperparameter tuning and 
model fitting.
Support Vector Regression (SVR) (Python & R): Applied for modeling gene 
expression data with linear kernel.
Feature Selection and Analysis:
Mutual Information (Python)
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) (Python & R)
Correlation Analysis (Python & R)
Model Evaluation: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error 
(RMSE) are used for model evaluation.
Baseline Comparison: Comparison with a dummy regressor to establish 
baseline performance.
Visualization: Various plots (scatter, density, cumulative distribution, 
Q-Q, violin plots) are used to visualize the data and model results.
Results

The project's analysis reveals insights into gene expression data and the 
effectiveness of different machine learning models in predicting gene 
scores. Key findings include:

Feature importance and selection insights from RFE and mutual information.
Model performance comparison using RMSE.
Visualization of actual vs. predicted values.
