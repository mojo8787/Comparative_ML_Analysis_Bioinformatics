# Comparative Machine Learning Analysis in Bioinformatics

## Introduction
This project focuses on comparative machine learning analysis in the field of bioinformatics, specifically examining gene expression data. The analysis involves various machine learning techniques, 
including Random Forest, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and other regression models, to predict and analyze gene expression scores.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Used for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
  - Key Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
- **R**: Employed for statistical analysis and visualization.
  - Key Libraries: `tidyverse`, `caret`, `e1071`, `rpart`, `randomForest`, `ggplot2`, `readr`, `ggpubr`
